# Web Mining

In this section, we performed web mining to extract useful data from various sources. Here are the important points:

## Overview

This section contains scripts used for web scraping to collect data from the artsy website.

## Used technologies

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for scripting.
- **Scrapy:** An open source and collaborative web crawling framework for Python.
- **Spider:** A Scrapy component used to define how to follow links on a website and extract information from pages.
- **JSON:** A lightweight data interchange format used to store extracted data.

## Process

1. **Defining Spiders:** We used Scrapy spiders to define rules for crawling and parsing web pages.
2. **Data Extraction:** Spiders crawled the websites and extracted relevant data.
3. **Storage of Data:** The extracted data was stored in JSON format for further analysis and visualization.
